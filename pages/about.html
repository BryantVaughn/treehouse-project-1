				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					Hi! My name is Bryant Vaughn and I'm originally from California, but
					now call Denver, CO my home. Throughout life I've always had an
					interest in technology and how things worked "behind the scenes".
					After moving to Colorado in 2014, I decided to go back to school and
					finish my degree in computer science, which I completed in December
					2019! When I'm not working, studying, or tinkering with projects, I
					really enjoy traveling with my wife.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've worked many different jobs throughout my life such as a pizza
					shop manager, an asphault paving crew member, a tire shop employee, a
					licensed and registered financial broker, an application support
					intern, and a systems analyst. These different positions have helped
					me grow and learn knew things that I've applied to my professional
					career and also my personal life.
				</p>
